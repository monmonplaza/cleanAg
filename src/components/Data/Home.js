Utilizing the know-how that has been involved in sterilization and antibacterial deodorant products for about 30 years, from the nano-level silver ions that are generally available ultra-fine silver ion “Clean Tech Series” with 1/1000 finer particles. The sterilization system is completely different and I am convinced that its effectiveness, efficacy and sustainability are better beyond comparison to other sterilization, antibacterial and deodorant agents as well as nano silver, but also the top class in the world from the data. \nBased on this pico silver ion “Clean Tech Series”, we will continue to carry out further research and aim for product development in all fields.\nA clean environment for people, nature and the future …`,

    silverIon:
      "“Silver”, which has been said to have mysterious power since ancient times\n “Silver” has been regarded as very valuable since ancient times by preventing the decay of important water and curing various diseases. According to the records of ancient Indian medical books, when soldiers went on an expedition, they kept drinking water in a silver jar to prevent plague.\nSilver is a metal produced by nature, and when the metal “silver (Ag)” is placed in water, a small amount of silver ions (Ag +) elutes. In ancient times, water placed in silver jars did not rot because it contained trace amounts of silver ions.\nIn 1929, German G. Klaus discovered the bactericidal effect of silver ions eluted by electrolyzing silver in water. Taking advantage of this excellent bactericidal effect, it was later used as a treatment for cholera.",
