    question:
      "How is Clean AG+‘s “Pico Silver” different from the “Nano Silver” you often hear?",
    answer:
      "Nano silver has a fine atomic level of 10 to the 9th power, but the “pico silver” we handle is an ultrafine silver ion with particles as fine as 1/1000 . The effect, efficacy, and durability are not comparable to other disinfectants, antibacterial agents, and deodorants, let alone “nano silver”. For example, in the case of the clean AG+ mist type, 1/1000 nano-fine particles are scattered with a single blow, so the surroundings instantly change to clean air and the effect lasts for a long time.",

    question:
      "On the contrary, I’ve heard that drinking silver ions makes you feel better … ?",
    answer:
      "The silver ions handled by Clean AG+ have a very high concentration and are not recommended for drinking at all. (That’s why it is very effective.) However, a very small amount of silver ionized water (about 0.5 mg of silver per 1 L of water) is popular because it has the effect of smoothing blood because there are folk medicines to drink in Europe and the United States. However, silver ion water drinks are also sold in Japan as being good for your health.",

    question: " I have a baby, is it okay to use it?",
    answer:
      "Clean ag+ is all non-alcoholic and fragrance-free, so even delicate babies can use it with confidence.",

  {
    question: "Can it be used in an aquarium?",
    answer:
      "There is an image that using silver ions in an aquarium will make the water clean, but it is very important to control the concentration of silver ions, and it seems difficult for an amateur, so please refrain from using it. In addition, since silver ions are adsorbed on the gills of the fish, it may interfere with the respiration of the fish, so be careful.",
